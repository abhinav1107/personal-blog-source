This is my first of hopefully more-than-one blog posts. I have high hopes for this new endeavor. If anyone learns something from this blog, I'll consider it a smashing success.

Look at me, I am blogging. (Again ðŸ™„)

Now that I've finished my compulsory meta commentary where I write about the experience of writing, I'm ready to get down to business.

Blogging Goals
--------------

### 1. Contribute to the online Community

I'd like to be an active participant of the wide and wonderful world of DevOps, not just a passive consumer. If it's possible for me to write something that one stranger on the internet finds useful, I'll have knocked this goal out of the park. I know I'm setting the bar pretty low, but hey, baby steps!

### 2. Document My Learning

I've learned so, so much all these years. How much of it do you think I've written down? Survey says, not nearly enough!

Recently I had to implement something which I had implemented in my previous organization and documented in company's repo. If you don't use it, you lose it, obviously. Now that I have joined a different company, I had to implement the same thing and since I didn't have access to previous documentation, I had to re-learn all of it. Putting those previous learnings in a blog post would have certainly helped.

### 3. Communicate with Future Teammates or Employers

Crazy, right? Using this blog I can literally talk with people I don't know yet... from the _future_.

In point #1 my audience is unknown, random folks hoping to solve a specific problem or learn something new. In #2 the audience is me. And in #3, my audience is people I may one day have the pleasure of working with. It's important to me (and hopefully to them, too) that we understand each other as well as possible, and I don't feel like the standard tech interview process always succeeds at accomplishing that. Sometimes stuff gets lost in translation or never gets translated at all.

If you, potential employer or coworker of the future, want to know how I think, how I express myself, or what I'm curious about, then I want this to be a good place to start. Hopefully you'll find my writing to be a more engaging and accurate representation of my work than the outcome of an arbitrary whiteboard algorithm session.

I've already written way more than I had expected for my first post. If I get all my great ideas out now, I'll have nothing left to write about and this will have been a fun but very short experiment. Stay tuned for the next positively scintillating post.
