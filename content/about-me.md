If I have to describe myself professionally in one sentence, I would probably say "`I fix things`". This is not something of a trait that I picked along working. I have been fixing things as long as I could remember. My oldest memory related to fixing something is from 4th standard. I came home from school and wanted to "`fix`" a fused bulb, which didn't go too well.

I'm a passionate DevOps engineer with a mission to streamline development workflows, enhance collaboration, and automate all the things. My expertise lies in:
- **DevOps Practices:** Implementing best practices for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
- **Containerization:** Leveraging Docker and Kubernetes to create scalable and portable applications.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Using tools like Terraform to define and manage infrastructure.
- **Automation:** Writing scripts and workflows to automate mundane tasks and improve efficiency.
- **Cloud Technologies:** Proficient in cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Outside of work, I am a passionate photographer and biker, with a love for adventure and outdoors. When I'm not working, you can find me cruising around on my bike and exploring new trails. I'm always looking for opportunities to combine my interests and capture beautiful moments through my camera lens.
